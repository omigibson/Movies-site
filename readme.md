This is simple Wordpress site I made as a coding test for a potential employer.

It uses [Guzzle](http://docs.guzzlephp.org) to fetch movies from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), then it automatically posts the movie data as Wordpress posts.

The functionality lives in the functions.php of the twntytwenty-child theme.
